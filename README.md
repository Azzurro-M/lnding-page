# Landing Page Project


# How I developped the website
I have focused firstly in copying part of the website design from FIGMA, I have used the design key elements like colors, font, logo, but have adjusted the page in a way that helped me create css and JS on time for my project deadline.

I have started with a medium size screen and ajusted the media for mobiles.

I have created nav list items, h2 elemnts and all important events like scroll and highlight and anchor tags to connect nav menu to page sections through JS.

It hasn't been easy for me so I know there is a better way to create functions but im still learning and that's what i managed to come up with by myself.
